### Automate Flask app deployment using Fabric python library easily
#### Required python version
```sh
$ python --version
Python 3.5.5
```
#### Note: I am using my old Flask repo code for this tutorial and I am assuming that you have already installed all dependencies from https://github.com/doing007/productionize-ml-model

I have created new file called fabfile.py file manually, which is where I am going to write my all code to perform the tasks in server from our local machine
